<h1>Scientific Calculator in C</h1>

<p>This project is a <strong>Scientific Calculator</strong> built in <strong>C</strong>, capable of performing both basic arithmetic and advanced scientific operations. It supports both integer and floating-point calculations.</p>

<p>The calculator includes the following features:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Basic Arithmetic:</strong> Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division</li>
    <li><strong>Advanced Scientific Operations:</strong> Trigonometry (sin, cos, tan), Logarithms (log, ln), Exponentiation (x^y)</li>
    <li><strong>Support for Integer and Floating-Point Calculations</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Console Interface:</strong> Simple, user-friendly command-line interface</li>
</ul>

<p>The calculator provides an easy-to-use console interface for the user to input mathematical expressions, making it ideal for both basic and scientific calculations.</p>

<h2>Key Features:</h2>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Arithmetic Operations:</strong> Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.</li>
    <li><strong>Trigonometric Functions:</strong> sin, cos, tan, and their inverses (asin, acos, atan).</li>
    <li><strong>Logarithmic Functions:</strong> log (base 10), ln (natural logarithm).</li>
    <li><strong>Exponentiation:</strong> Ability to raise a number to any power.</li>
    <li><strong>Support for both Integer and Floating-Point Numbers</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Simple Command-Line Interface</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>To run the calculator, compile the C program and run it via your console. Input expressions as requested, and the program will output the result accordingly.</p>

<h2>Example Usage:</h2>

<pre>
$ gcc calculator.c -o calculator
$ ./calculator

Enter operation (+, -, *, /, sin, cos, tan, log, ln, exp): sin
Enter value (in radians): 1.5708
Result: 1
</pre>

<p>This project provides a foundation for implementing more advanced features, and can be expanded further with additional scientific functions, error handling, or a more complex user interface in the future.</p>
